The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS.  However, there's a common error where spaces are unexpectedly inserted around the operators (+, -, *, /) within the `calc()` function, leading to unexpected results or parsing errors.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px)` works correctly, but `width: calc(100% - 20 px)` will likely fail.
